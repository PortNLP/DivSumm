Now that the Christmas vacation is over it’s been hard for parents to wake up early to take their kids to school.Most people have gained weight because of eating and less exercise.A lot of people are yet to take down their Christmas tree.Some don't want to take down the trees because they are emotionally attached to it.Other people are just being lazy to take down their own christmas tree.
