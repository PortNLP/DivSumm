I been a Kobe fan since 96' when he got drafted same thing with the Lakers. Kobe you are amazing! You will always be the best player of all time to me! 1996 brought us Kobe Bryant, Derek Jeter, Ray Lewis and Tiger Woods. Four of the best to ever do it. To clarify, Lebron is a BEAST. No doubt a legend. But no one beats Kobe but Jordan. And that's a fact. \nSorry Mike, it's time for Kobe to move on or retire.
