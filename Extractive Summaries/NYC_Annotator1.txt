I really hate NYC weather right now. I wish I was somewhere warm :-(  I just need to move to NYC and live that life.... Who down with me?? You're more likely to find unicorns in NYC than happy people. Next year I will be in NYC for New Years :party_popper: :party_popper:  Just woke up from the most awesome nap to the most horrible reality, im in fucking NYC -_-
