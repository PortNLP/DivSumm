\f0\fs24 \cf0 seeing this movie makes me want to go to Paris even more :disappointed_face: I want to live in Paris for a summer sometime. :airplane: :seat: :ticket:. When I saw Paris Hilton trending I thought it was gonna be something related to bjs or sextapes. I don't think Paris is as great as everyone makes it out to be.  If I had a chance to chose a place I can go to , to be away from everyone I would chose Paris. That's my dream to go to Paris ..}
