Its a rough life being an Eagles fan sometimes :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:Ó I knew them Eagles was gona be sumthin else this year.. Eagles are still gna lose.. Despite that nice rush TD right meow. it's alright, haters gonna hate, just watch the Eagles take the SB home sooner than later :winking_face:.
