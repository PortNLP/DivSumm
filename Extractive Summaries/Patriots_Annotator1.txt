Pops is gonna buy me a Patriots Jersey on Black Friday. Patriots always find a fucking way to win. God damn. Another reason I don't like the Patriots. When I ACTUALLY root for them they play like this. Thanks Brady! Also thanks Denver and Manning! no Patriots fan but the home team cool just not a fan. Theres not much that makes me happier than seeing the Patriots lose.
