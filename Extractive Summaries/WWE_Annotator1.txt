I got 99 problems and none of them are about the WWE . Just being honest: i've been loving hockey and completely bored with wrestling both WWE and TNA. Sooooo much going on tonight that I totally forgot about WWE Night of Champions!#GoAheadAndJudgeMe. Hell yeah watching #WWE #RoyalRumble with my family &lt;3 Lets go Cena!!!! . I dont like reality shows but this WWE show just reminds of how much I loved it as a kid. :squinting_face_with_tongue: #TotalDivas
