In the last 3 years, whichever team Eagles faced in home opener went on to win the Super Bowl, (Saints, Packers, Giants)Ó Lol :face_with_tears_of_joy:Mad that my Eagles lost but so did the Cowboys, and the Redskins, so the Division still looks the same! :thumbs_up:We were also in Elementary School when Eagles were Good lolCan't believe Chip Kelly is coaching the Philadelphia Eagles. They're in for a good season now. #SorryOregonCan't believe that there is a high possibility Brian Kelly may become the Eagles next head coach..............Fahck
