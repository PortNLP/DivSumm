Oh yeaaa Chicago bulls beat the Miami heat fuk u heat :D !!! &lt;33 best day everWind chills below zero last night in #Chicago. Its another beautiful winter day in the city of Chicago. I thank God its a little warmer today. Plus myself and others who can see today.530 black kids have been killed in Chicago since 2008 from gun violence....Nothing happens... 26 white kids get killed in school.. GUN BANIs it possible those restrictive laws in Chicago are not being properly enforced, as Wayne LaPierre said? I'm not anti-gun,btw.
