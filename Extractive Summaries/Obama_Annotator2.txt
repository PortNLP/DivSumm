Listen to the tone Obama is the chief divider in this country he will never be the work together presidentTeabaggers/RWNJs just can't stand that President Obama won a second term. Bless their tiny little hating heats.The SS tax increase was necessary for the life of the program, but isn't it wonderful that it came in Obama's tax bill.They're trying to impeach President Obama over gun control...for real?! C'mon son…These people talkin bout Michelle Obama and wat she wore omg
