It’s an NBA game night.Many people are tuned in because it's the first game of the season.There are different reactions to the game because some think it's awesome and some think it's whack.It would greatly have to do with fans(the team they support).Viewers also gave opinions of different players they consider to be the best and Lebron is thought to be overhyped.
