All Tweets seem to contain ‘NBA’ regardless of placement or context, often even including tweets where NBA is part of a word such as “FANBASE”.Overall the majority of tweets seem to be in-regards to the National Basketball Association, NBA, and include more often critiques or ‘insults’ of competing teams.It is also evident that the ‘NBA’, as a brand, include different ancillary businesses such as ‘NBA League Pass’, NBATV, and NBA2K13 (video game) in conjunction with the obvious basketball games themselves.A portion of the sample includes a notable use of racial epitaphs or slurs that may or may not be used in derision.The overwhelming bulk of the tweets is of a negative (critiquing, admonishing) nature as opposed to a positive (hopeful, cheering) message.
