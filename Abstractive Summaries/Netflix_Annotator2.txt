Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service where people watch movies or shows.It is very addictive and people get sad when they can't watch Netfkix because they have other things to do.People also find it difficult to pay for it at times and ask to use other people’s accounts for free.Netflix has really interesting movies but not everyone feels that way but they are few.Netflix is a way of relaxing/chilling after a long.
