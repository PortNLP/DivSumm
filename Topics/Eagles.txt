Hisp	Hotel California by The Eagles reminds me of my dad so much.. He loves that song
Hisp	"Cowboys are the only team that won this week, looks like Redskins are lost and we know what happened to the Eagles already. #Giantshope"
Hisp	"Mad that my Eagles lost but so did the Cowboys, and the Redskins, so the Division still looks the same! \ud83d\udc4d"
Hisp	Eagles are still gna lose.. Despite that nice rush TD right meow
Hisp	Andy Reid loved the turnovers by the Eagles almost as much as the ones made by Pillsbury\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d
Hisp	Pinches butter fingers. Come in defense hold the line #Eagles
Hisp	My goodness.... Eagles have to throw in the white towel
Hisp	Fuck man in at work and going to miss the first half of the eagles game -.- #EaglesNation
Hisp	"it's alright, haters gonna hate, just watch the Eagles take the SB home sooner than later \ud83d\ude09"

Hisp	I'm just hoping the Eagles can keep it up at this point
Hisp	"it makes no sense man haha. But when I see her I'll tell her 'you might be an Eagles fan, BUT YOU DON'T ME!!!'"
White	Just found out the Eagles interviewed Brian Billick ugh nooo
White	Now its only right to bring back the Kelly Green jerseys #GoEagles #ChipKelly
White	So the Eagles fans wanted rid of Andy Reid because of his poor red zone play calling and clock management... But want Brian Kelly?
White	Andy Reid becomes the new Chiefs Head Coach and the Eagles host the Chiefs in 2013. Already something to look forward to.
White	"Eagles fan. And NFL still ultimate proving grounds, I think."
White	who cares about stupid hockey? If Reuban Frank wants to talk Eagles which is his job let him. There are many people who hate hoc
White	Can't believe that there is a high possibility Brian Kelly may become the Eagles next head coach..............Fahck
White	I wonder who the Eagles head coach will be next season!
White	"In the last 3 years, whichever team Eagles faced in home opener went on to win the Super Bowl, (Saints, Packers, Giants)\u201d Lol \ud83d\ude02"
White	come to Philadelphia and well put you at OLB...what would you think about that? #Eagles
White	As long as the Eagles or Steelers suck I'm happy.
White	no way the Eagles will ever have the same offense as Oregon. Chip Kelly won't be able to control NFL vets like he did college kids
White	"If #Eagles fans think Gus Bradley's tough attitude alone will fix the Eagles, they're wrong"
White	all I know is if Brady played for the Eagles or Giants-- you all would love him :)
White	After a successful college career he was drafted 25th overall in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles.
White	Mitchell played 4 seasons with the Eagles and one offseason with the Chiefs in his average NFL career. He also loves his hands...
White	7-1 run by Kirkwood has this a 17-16 game. Eagles trail by one.
White	Wish I wasn't working so I could go to the basketball game :( #GoEagles
White	Man I really can't get enough of these Kelly Eagles jokes #not
White	At this point just list the names of coaches that the Eagles haven't interviewed..here ill do it..1.Jon Gruden end.
White	Obvious Eagles spin will be they wanted to interview every1 then make decision &amp; will never admit the Kelly's had the gig if they wanted it
White	Praying that Brian Kelly takes the head coaching job at the Eagles!!
White	i guess the Eagles should go after Tebow now #sorryFoles
White	"Calling it now. Eagles 12-4 with a prolific offense, 1st in NFC East, and make it to the Conference Championship. #thisisawesome"
White	#Oregon HC Chip Kelly will become the #PHIEagles new HC
White	Feel Bad for RG3...torn ACL and LCL..praying that his surgery goes well..though I am a Eagles fan..RG3 is excite. and good for the gm!
White	....thoughts on Eagles hiring Chip Kelly? Did the changes of offenses in the NFL just get a lot faster with this hire?
White	Gahanna Christian up 38-24 at the end of the third. #GCAEaglesBasketball
White	Who was the first person to use the term #AquaEagles?
White	Can't believe Chip Kelly is coaching the Philadelphia Eagles. They're in for a good season now. #SorryOregon
