Hisp	The Seahawks game would of been 10x better if it was at night
White	"Now ATL was playing the Skins, I might spread my $$ around. Lol. But the Seahawks? I don\u2019t see a win for ATL."
White	"Seahawks not good on road, Redskins not great at home. Both teams on a roll. RG3 not 100%. I'll take Seattle, 24-21."
White	I almost wanna root for our NFC south foe solely because the Seahawks are feeling themselves entirely too much
White	"Hey non-Falcons/non-Seahawks fans: how did you pick your side today? I'm so conflicted, but can't do the 'I want a good game' thing."
White	Wow here come the Hawks again. Damm they don't quit do they. #Seahawks #Playoffs
White	Joe Buck is still a homo. Aikman needs a better sidekick. This should be a good game. #Seahawks. Hope they can win without the 12th man
White	Peyton is killing it right now and Seahawks have that momentum the past few champs have all had coming into the playoffs
White	I dislike the Seahawks ALMOST as much as the Cowgirls. #HTTR
White	Had broncos beating Seahawks in the Super Bowl. And they both lost. Life sucks :/
White	"I hate watching the Seahawks get crushed. In other news, happy opposite day."
White	My dream Super Bowl would be Seahawks vs Broncos #predictions
White	Seahawks +1 @ falcons?!?! Line is right but damn was hoping they'd throw some more points out for the public.
White	Seahawks are borrowing the Vikings' clown suit from last night.
White	If the Seahawks pull off this comeback it would make my day
White	that'll be good game! Seahawks gonna go all the way though.
White	"Ok, that was a great series. Seahawks will adjust but getting 7 there is huge. #HTTR!"
White	"These playoffs suck, but I'd love to see nothing more than RGIII getting blown out. #Seahawks #please"
White	"#Seahawks all I have is one simple request, please...beat the #falcons they don't deserve to play in the Superbowl at the Superdome"
White	Seahawks are my favorite to win the Superbowl. What a game.
White	Eastern came from a 35-0 deficit... Lets see the Seahawks do it.
White	Like inevitably signing a Seahawks FA. Little known league rules.
White	U deserved that Seahawks got into the playoffs cause off the refs
White	#Seahawks are a man coverage secondary so if Gar\u00e7on/Morgan can hold their blocks #Redskins will run all day
White	Isn't it weird to think the Seahawks QB this time last season was Tarvaris Jackson? Now he's the third string QB on the Bills hahaha.
White	Lmao my mom said you want the Seahawks to to win ? Stay in room all day and don't come out! Hahaha
White	The entire Seattle Seahawks team is at my hotel right now....everyone's flippin
White	Looks like we got our heads out of our asses. #Seahawks
White	it does but Russel will come around. The Seahawks defense will make adjustments. It will b a good game
White	"Seahawks have mad some stupid calls and mistakes so far, they've been awful!"
White	would be proud to hear these words slip my lips. I am rooting for the Seattle Seahawks. #flockout
