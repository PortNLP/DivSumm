White	ShutUp... We have fought over this ssince middle school hahaha. Dolphins and Lakers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Patriots and Celtics
White	"I'm pulling for the Falcons and Ravens, so we can look forward to a Patriots/49ers Superbowl. I'll be pulling for the Pats. Congrats, 49ers."
White	bittersweet feeling. It's been fun but we ain't done yet! #RoadToNewOrleans #GoPatriots
White	Imma take a nap. I need all my energy for this Patriots game.
White	I could almost care less about thr 3 oclock game.. But really looking forward to the #Ravens and #Patriots tonight
White	Well I'm 3-0 in my Playoff picks this week...I have the Texans beating the Patriots tonight too.Think ill be 4-0 when it's all said and done
White	The Cruise tomorrow night better have the Patriots game on
White	The cruise tomorrow night better have the Patriots game on
White	knows what's up when it comes to the Patriots. He's killing it with the tweets today #hatethosefaggots
White	I plan on spending my tax money on a bunch of #Patriots gear what y'all think??
White	"If the Patriots would've won in the final 30 seconds, it would be all over ESPN non-stop."
White	By the way: Gronk is done for the year. #CountOnIt #Patriots
White	Benard Pollard might want to avoid leading with his head. #Patriots
White	Theres not much that makes me happier than seeing the Patriots lose.
White	"My cousin played for the Patriots, I love my cousin but I hate the Patriots lol"
White	Food for thought: any 49er matchup (Ravens or Patriots) way sexier than Falcons. Did this come into play on that last non-call? #justsaying
White	The Patriots just have little firecrackers for running backs! #Patriots
White	"I have an idea of how u can pay the bet of the #Patriots losing, and keep ur hat good."
White	"Man, the #Patriots blew it. Guess it's time to cheer for the #49ers! At least my second fave team made it to the Super Bowl!"
White	w.t.F. happened yesterday night? Did the Patriots trade outfits with a Boston high school team?
White	Good morning Patriots! May God smile upon you and bless you all!
White	If the Patriots win my hours become a force Next week I needs that!!!
White	"We all said we didn't want the Patriots in another Super Bowl. Well, we were lying."
White	Another reason I don't like the Patriots. When I ACTUALLY root for them they play like this. Thanks Brady! Also thanks Denver and Manning!
White	"I hope now that Manning is out for a Patriots 49ers Super Bowl, and just cheers to the winner. What? I like Harbaugh and Bellichick."
White	AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME: Ravens beat Patriots 28-13. Hope y'all are ready for the Super Har-bowl!
White	I just want the Patriots to lose.\u201d Come on nah my G
White	So Pollard Has Been Head Hunting Patriots His Whole Career\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udcaf
White	This was a decent season for the #Patriots and they made the AFC Championship. I guess happiness is relative.
White	I cannot wait to watch the game Sunday. I strongly dislike the Patriots.
