I still haven't taken down my Christmas tree, I think I'm emotionally attached...... Not really I'm just lazy.Christmas is officially over when you bring that Christmas tree down !   ,All I got for Christmas was 10 extra pounds. #$%& you, Santa.Breakfast at Tiffany's & taking my Christmas decorations down    #finallyFirst day I wake up at 7 to take Isaac to school since Christmas vacation and not loving it
