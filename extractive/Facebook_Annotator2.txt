Ive noticed that facebook makes you hate people you actually know. Twitter makes you love people you've never metMy twitter and instagram replaced my facebook toss off facebook :) #sohappyjust because you message me on facebook and its marked as 'seen' does NOT mean im EVER obligated to message you back. gross.Nowadays the only notifications I get on facebook are people poking me... #comeonif i die and people post statuses about me on facebook and act like they knew me or were nice to me i will come back and fucking murder them
