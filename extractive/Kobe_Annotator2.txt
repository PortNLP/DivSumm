1996 brought us Kobe Bryant, Derek Jeter, Ray Lewis and Tiger Woods. Four of the best to ever do it. It doesn't take the average person ( #Thinkonit ) to understand Kobe cannot pass MJ as the greatest to ever play.Kobe with a big finish but not enough to win! Lol. #SorryLakerFansTo clarify, Lebron is a BEAST. No doubt a legend. But no one beats Kobe but Jordan. And that's a fact.Kobe is the 2nd most assassin like scorer ever. Behind Jordan. KD still has a ways to go.
