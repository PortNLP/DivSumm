I just need to move to NYC and live that life.... Who down with me?? People its call WINTER we experience it once a year in NYC. Now stop complaining. Cara! The next time you're in Boston or maybe if I'm down in NYC again (hopefully), could we maybe have a writing session? I really can't wait till you decide to hit up NYC/NJ again. Miss you! Excited for a week of classes and shows in NYC with #ComPAny2013!!!!
