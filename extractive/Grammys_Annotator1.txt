I cannot even explain how excited I am watching these 2001 Grammys... JT performing! :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:. Too many lovely performances yesterday :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: One Direction, Carlos Vives, Marc Anthony, Pitbull! #XFactor #LatinGrammys. Imma wear the yellow tux to the Grammys, and rock out with my cock out. These Grammys need some life in it cause I'm so bored. According to my TL...the Grammys is more about fashion not music....
