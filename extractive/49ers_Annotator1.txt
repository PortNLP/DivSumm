The falcons gonna get murked by the 49ers next week. 49ers are the overall favorite but Ray Lewis gonna get that Super Bowl ring before he retire. If the 49ers are in the Superbowl i will not be watching....If I had folks like the 49ers, I would be a true spread team also. that 49ers vs falcons game gone be some good shit.
