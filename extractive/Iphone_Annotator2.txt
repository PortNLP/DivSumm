I need to get the life proof case for my new iphone but damn its 80$, could save me money in the long run thoughWhy did apple have to make diff chargers for 5 than rest of the iphones? To separate us? To make a division from elite and the plain folk?!Btw... Finally upgraded to the iPhone. Need some tips for best use. #help #iphonei want a new phone . tired of the iphone .gots to go tmobile nd get my new phone #iphone 5
