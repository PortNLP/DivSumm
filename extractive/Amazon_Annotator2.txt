My one book for school is a penny on amazon and fifteen dollars at the bookstore. #conspiracyBeen calling amazon all this month it's been 2nonths my shit still ain't come smhUhhhh just got an email that the comparative politics book I ordered is apparently lost...cool amazon, coolEveryones out camping for black Friday and I'm just here in my pajamas loving the amazon deals.One touch buy option from amazon is gonna clean out my checking account! #sufferingaddict
